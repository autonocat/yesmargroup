        <p>February 21st, the SP500 was at $3,337, upon the Coronavirus sell off, we hit a low of $2,237 on March 23rd (ironically) – shaving off 32% in under a month.</p>
        <p>Come May 16th and the SP 500 closes at $2,863, a 15% drawdown – yet we’ve seen record unemployment numbers over the last eight weeks with about 36.5 million people filing for unemployment insurance, pushing the rate to an unprecedented 17% - levels we haven’t seen since pre-WWII and the 1929 Great Depression..</p>
        <p>...Yet stocks are rebounding as indices are broadly up since their March 23rd lows... </p>
        <p>It seems paradoxical to say that a lot of the opportunities I’m eyeing are ‘overbought’ as we see that Peloton has swept tailwinds from the exercise from home trends, regardless of sales have increased to the point where it justifies an 88% share price gain on the year. As a matter of fact, all companies that I’m eying are up 20%+ unless they have a retail footprint such as Revolve and The Real Real (down -60% & -56% respectively).</p>
        <p>But this isn’t an essay about the macro economy as a whole, or the misnomers of the market, its an analysis on some future opportunities that: at a high level 1) fit the Mana mandate, 2) are good businesses to invest in once valuations are more attractive, and 3) will require more diligence (specifically the ones with targeted in red) on an investment opportunity. </p>
        <p>A note on portfolio management: I don’t need to invest in these new companies either, there will be a limit for my independent research capabilities, however being able to silo my investments in a theme help consolidate the general research I’d need to do for companies like Shopify, Chewy, Revolve etc.. But again, I don’t need to invest in these companies – it just adds more work on my end eventually. </p>
        <p>I had the fortune to not look at my portfolio during the depths of the pandemic (mainly because I had no cash to invest) but now that things are looking better, I might look to add more to my positions – or double down on my frontier investments that have been hit the hardest. </p>
        <p>Part 2 will come with an indepth reveiew of the selected opportunities.</p>

      <h2 class="font-weight-light">What Will The Future Of Investment Banking Look Like?</h2>
      <div id = "content">
        <h6>April-22-2020</h6>
      </div>
      <img src="IB-revenues.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content"> <p>With interest rates at record low levels, the question for managers arise: Buy, Build or Partner? This then raises another question: How will we fund the choice we make? Through Debt or Equity? If you ask a Boutique Bank, a majority of their answers will point towards equity as they don't have a debt desk and look towards the advisory fee. So then for managers, they must decide: hire a boutique bank with sector expertise and thought leadership? Or hire a full-service bulge bracket bank that can provide staple financing - if needed. Of course this is simplifying the process, but the point still stands.</p>
        <p>Do we chalk up Investment Banking success to rainmakers at the firm? Incentive packages through stock and options? Higher deal fee splits? Or Merging let's say a Jeffereis Group with a Stephens Inc. to create a JeffereisStephens Group - which will equate to a firm that has enhanced Capital Markets capabilities, a stronger balance sheet and a larger deal making team to spearhead a larger fee pool. Arguably enabling two Middle Market firms to compete within the larget Bugle Bracket category. </p>
        <p>What goes to say for independent M&A Advisors such as Centerview, Moelis, LionTree, FT Partners and PWP? All of the likes started with similar rainmakers defuncting from their bulge bracket homes to create a more nimble, independent advisory firm. When these founders leave the babies they created - what will become of their brands and the franchises they sought to build? For one thing, having a name that is founder agnostic might help. But without pursuing diversifed  revenue streams, these businesses might falter in the future.</p>
        <p>Or they could become the likes of a Lazard, legacy advisory shop, founded in 1848 and commits to pure advisory services..</p>
        <img src="Investment-banking2-2019.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Investment Banking is no different than any other industry. Scale, Revenue Growth and Margins are essentials to business and when one goes public, pressure is put on to maximize those metrics above. The most recent wave of consolidation has come from the merger of Piper Jaffray and Sandler O'Neill as Piper Sandler Companies. The resulting company represents one of the broadest full-service investment banking platforms on Wall Street complemented by one of the largest securities distribution and trading franchises with leading market research aligned to serve the middle-market.</p>
        <p>So maybe we will see an eventual JeffereisStephens Groups, or a RaymondJefferies Group...</p>

      </div>
      <img src="SPCE-One-Page-vF.png" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content"> <p>Virgin Galactic is an interesting play because they fit right into this lens I'm trying to analyze industrial companies in: High Margin, Technologically Advanced, American Manufacturing with prominent leadership – Virgin has all of this. This business is reminiscent of Tesla in the early days. We entered this investment around February and have been taking hits from their speculation as well as the damper from the CoronaVirus. 

      <p>With respect to their TAM and opening this up to the masses, I feel there is a fundamental business of selling the space experience here. $250k is not that much to spend on a one in a lifetime event like this. Imagine a Kardashian live streaming from space, or someone live streaming the first trade from space, the first MMA fight from space etc..</p> 

      <p>At the core, Virgin is an entertainment company and Branson is using Space as a platform so sell experiences.</p>

      <img src="Social-Digital-Media-Landscape.png" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content"> <p>Facebook, the largest social media platform has acquired, or outright copied competing platforms, as you can see below: </p> 
        <ul>
          <li> April 2012: Facebook Acquired Instagram to appeal to a younger crowd </li>
          <li> To Snap’s demise, Evan Spiegel reportedly turned down an acquisition offer from Facebook in late 2013</li>
          <li> August 2016 rolls around and Instagram adds Stories to the platform, Snapchat’s defining feature</li>
          <li> In the mean time, Persicope was founded in March 2015, a platform for users to live broadcast themselves to people who tune into their periscopes </li>
          <li> Facebook introduced Instagram Live Stories in November 2016 – which was Persicope’s defining feature: a smaller company again had their defining feature stolen by Facebook – not to say that any company ‘owns’ a piece of software – it’s software for god’s sake</li>
          <li> VSCO has failed to scale as people truly like ‘likes’ and numbers on their impressions – is there room for a platform to scale without the use of likes and followers? TechCrunch cites that in the midst of the CoronaVirus crisis VSCO has laid off 30% of their workforce</li>
        </ul>
      <p>However, It seems like FinTech startups have rose up in the face of incumbents (Cash App’s rise because they serve the underserved areas/segments?! – a snippet from Jack Dorsey on the Joe Rogan Podcast) – all this success in relation to Venmo, ebay, Paypal, VISA, etc… Fintech might be a new vertical to analyze...</p>
