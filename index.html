        <p>Visa…we all know the name. The better Mastercard, you know the ones with the “thunk”? At a first glance, we think Visa is in the business of issuing credit cards, but that’s far from the truth. Visa is a payments processor, not a financial institution. </p> 
        <p>Which means, Visa earns revenue by facilitating money movement. The $24bn in Net Revenues consist of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, minus client incentive arrangements. Visa does not issue cards, extend credit, or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products nor do they earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of these activities. </p>

        <p>TerraLuna, the ultimate lock & key I’ve been looking for. </p>
        <p>My passion for commerce + interest in blockchain has lad me to forming one of my highest conviction bets on the Terra Ecosystem. What’s unique here is the dual-pronged approach for stable payments on Terra via UST and the ability to participate in the upside via the burn mechanism of Luna. I personally don’t believe in maximalism but it seems like TFL has concocted an ecosystem that is impossible to ignore. Earn 20% on your savings with Anchor and spend in real—life with stablecoins on Kado. </p>
        <p>The only issue with living in stablecoins is getting to the promised land, is getting to Terra Station. Because of the DeFi layers, multiple swaps must be done which incur heavy gas fees since we’re using Ethereum as our gateway. A better fiat on/offramp would remove the need to even buy Ethereum on Coinbase and go through the swap headaches. You could however buy Luna on Voyager, but it’s a terrible platform. </p>

      </div>
      <div id = "content">
        <img src="kraken.jpg" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Kraken, among others has seen the valuation uptick in 2021 that most crypto projects had. As an exchange, (like DYDX) they are in the business of “facilitating” exchange in a very saturated and often commoditized industry. </p>
        <p>Kraken has a few things going for itself that most US-CEXs don’t. For instance, the Wyoming-based bank charter that was granted is a huge step in the right direction for bridging the fiat-to-crypto ecosystems. The Wyoming SPDI framework allows Kraken Bank to prioritize asset custody and safekeeping, data protection, security standards, and stringent regulatory oversight. SPDI banks are required to maintain full reserves, which means users’ money won’t be lent out without their permission. Kraken is looking into products like deposit accounts in USD,  crypto assets, multiple funding and payments options, institutional custody products, IRAs and much more. I wonder how scaling will work as Kraken won’t be able to participate in fractional reserve banking? </p>
        <p>Another growing product suite I’m seeing is Institutional Services for family offices, hedge funds etc. This is a natural next step as exchanges can charge high fees for access to crypto tools which would offset the eventual race to the bottom for retail crypto trading fees (like we saw with traditional asset classes). </p>
        <p>I also think CEXs have sort of a unique position to be a leader in education for retail traders. Coinbase’s learn program is innovative & helps otherwise unknowledgeable traders get a grasp on the basics of selected tokens. </p>

        <p>Exchange models have always interested me. With my background in marketplaces, the business model is pretty simple to understand: a take rate on every trade + upcharges on the more “exotic” products & features like derivatives & margin. However, building on chain with a Layer 2 via Starkware is an interesting approach which lends dydx’s comp set to more of a “DeFi Protocol” than an exchange business model like Coinbase. This helps them avoid the headwinds of traditional brokerage/exchanges which are currently racing to the bottom in terms of fees.</p>
        <p>Combine an already exotic product suite offering by dydx and a governance token that is powering an ecosystem to enable staking, LP mining & discounts/incentives on trades and there’s a formula for powerful ecosystem growth.</p>
        <p>Sign up was insanely easy as well. Just connect your Metamask Wallet, create a user and add your email and enable dydx to approve USDC through your Metamask and there you go. I just wish the whole product suite was available in the US.</p>

        <p>Beeple sold his 5,000 days for $69mm at Christie’s, so naturally as the adept powerpoint artist I am, I present to you piece #1 of my 365 days collection, where I’ll be profiling a project or company that’s interesting to me & hopefully you!</p>
        <p>On Jan 1, 2023 I will list the image collection on OpenSea for 69.420 ETH..obo.</p>
        <p>But seriously, take a took above at Republic Realm, who’s building out the future of Metaverse Real Estate development. The best way I can think about real estate development in the metaverse is really twofold: the first being a service offering for brands like Nike/Addidas/The Hundreds (fill in the blank) to offer POAP (Proof of Attendance access NFTs) for those who check into their virtual HQ. Or take for instance, the sneakerhead community. Instead of raffles, logging into a StockX or StadiumGoods virtual marketplace where you can bid real-time action house styled is also an avenue we can go down. Burnable POAPs, or redeemable NFTs are all possibilities when we think about mixing culture + digital assets together.</p>
        <p>Scarcity is also a very interesting debate to be had. Both Decentraland & Sandbox are “finite” in the sense they’re limited with 90k plots in Decentraland & ~160k plots in The Sandbox. Logically, the best devs / projects & talent will flock to the metaverses that offer the best experience & tools to build upon. More people will flock to where the devs & PMs (((best user/gaming experience))) are and an economy can flourish.</p>

        <h2 id="stabs" class="font-weight-light">Exploring the Intersection of Stablecoins & eCommerce</h2>
        <h6>Dec-5-2021</h6>
      </div>
      <div id = "content">
        <img src="stab1.JPG" style="width:100%;">
         <p><a href="stabxecomm.pdf">Print Friendly Version</a></p>
        <p>Consumer purchasing habits shifted from exclusively brick & mortar pre-2000’s to nearly a quarter online in a matter of 20 years. The broader eCommerce industry is ~$4.8tn in 2021 and is projected to be well over $6tn by 2024 and shows no signs of stopping.</p>
        <img src="stab2.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>As crypto adoption accelerates, a natural progression of our online spending habits will shift towards purchasing goods online with stablecoins. The yields in DeFi and shift towards a digital first lifestyle, driven by the proliferation of the metaverse is making blockchain-enabled ecosystems near impossible to ignore. </p>
        <p>DeFi adoption, like crypto more broadly, reflects other social and generational trends, including the rising digitization of our daily lives and shift towards decentralization. For example, surveys by the Federal Reserve show that cash use declined across all age groups during the pandemic, and that the 25-34 year-old age group used cash for only 10% of payments last year. This may be attributed to the growth of digital payment technologies like Venmo, ApplePay & Square. Stablecoins are a natural next step that will grow into a larger proportion of the digital payment ecosystem.</p>
        <img src="stab3.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum weren’t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange, they’re volatile and expensive to use, making it tough for merchants to accept as payment. Because only a small amount of merchants accept crypto as a payment option, crypto-natives still have many hoops to go through in order to pay for things in the “real world” such as food, rent, bills, etc.</p>
        <p>Even stablecoins held in a centralized wallet and converted by payment processors incur hefty fees and still “force” crypto-native personas to have to exit the cryptosphere and convert back to fiat. Self custodying your assets is also a huge positive externality that most normies don’t understand. When you self-custody your assets with a wallet like Metamask, you have near instant access to your funds. In a matter of minutes, you can “cash out” of your Bitcoin/Ethereum (insert token here) into a stablecoin of your choice. You’d then need to send your stables to a centralized wallet to “cash out” into fiat. This is a convoluted and expensive way to do what FTX & Coinbase are looking to fix with their debit card offerings.</p>
        <p>FTX is helping remove these layers with their own debit card. The FTX US card allows you to spend your balances on FTX US automatically on purchases. It works with any tokens on FTX US, not just USD. Effectively letting people use Bitcoin to pay for goods in the real-world. When you purchase something with your FTX card, FTX US will deduct that amount of funds from your balance. If you do not have USD, FTX US will convert your other coins to fund the purchase, the same way it would if you had negative USD. Coinbase is also following suit. </p>
        <p>For those non crypto-natives, stablecoins offer a near risk-free method of getting their feet wet into the crypto universe through a unique way to transact – minus the volatility of Bitcoin & Ethereum. The more people utilizing stablecoins, the larger the crypto ecosystem grows and the faster adoption happens while scaling the composability of this novel way to pay for goods online. </p>
        <p>Just as crypto isn’t only Bitcoin, eCommerce is much more than just buying goods online on Amazon. Massive tailwinds such as social / mobile commerce, gamification & niche marketplaces have been driving the industry to new heights. Stablecoins are faster, cheaper and a much more reliable means to transact with rather than Bitcoin. As merchants who accept Bitcoin as a means of exchange are taking steps in the right direction, they are ultimately using an inefficient model. Here we explore the intersections between stablecoins & buying goods online. </p>
        <p>Institutions and fintech along with eCommerce players are taking note, and like many are starting small with Bitcoin exposure and will gradually follow suit to onboard the Ethereum ecosystem which will eventually lead to stablecoins becoming as ubiquitous as traditional fiat check-out options in most online stores. </p>
        <img src="stab4.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Cumulative Ethereum addresses follow that of S-curve trajectory boasting ~178mm cumulative users. Metamask, the leading Ethereum Wallet application founded in 2016, boasted 10mm monthly active users in August of 2021. A surprising uptick compared to Coinbase’s 7.4mm number reported on November 9th. MetaMask’s exponential growth has tracked closely with that of the Ethereum ecosystem. In 2019, $2bn in crypto assets were committed to DeFi. Today, Ethereum supports a flourishing ecosystem with over $80bn in assets under management. Becoming impossible to ignore. </p>
        <p>The value in selecting a certain stablecoin resides in the dApp ecosystem enabled by the protocol, not necessarily just the stablecoin itself.</p>
        <p>Stablecoins came about as a means to pay for goods in a US Dollar denominated manner, while never leaving the blockchain ecosystem – a compelling value proposition as the top 5 stablecoins account for ~$143bn in market cap. These coins are pegged 1:1 to their respective currency. The most popular stablecoin by market cap being USDT, the USD peg by Hong-Kong based Tether. </p>
        <img src="stab7.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>A simple concept to grasp initially, has potential to be the most scalable innovations the blockchain has enabled. Take for instance an immigrant worker who came from a country like Nicaragua – we can call her Maria. Like many in her shoes do, they’re often supporting their families back home by sending USD via Western Union (fee) back to Nicaragua to be then converted (fee) into Nicaragua’s native currency, Cordobas. If they’re lucky, her family back home is banked, so the physical cash is stored away upon receipt. If not, they’re at risk of loss, theft or destruction. With stablecoins, Maria can link her debit card in the US to a wallet like Metamask, buy ETH, swap ETH for a stable of her choice to then be sent back to her families Metamask wallet address who owns their private keys & are self custodying their assets. This use case alone unlocks a massive value-add for currency swaps & cross-border commerce enablement. </p>
        <p>However, not all stablecoins are made alike. For example, in February 2019, JPMorgan became the first bank in the United States to create and test a digital coin that represents 1 USD. As the cryptocurrency industry grows, other banks, financial services companies, and even governments will create stable digital currencies (e.g., Central Bank Digital Currencies), as will large organizations outside of the finance sector. Facebook also announced its plans for Libra, “a stable digital cryptocurrency that will be fully backed by a reserve of real assets,” in June 2019. However, such proposals from JPM and Facebook forfeit the core value proposition of blockchain technology: global adoption of a common infrastructure without a central authority or administrator that may abuse its influence. This alone gives stablecoins built by crypto-native players an advantage over their centralized competitors.</p>
        <p>The Web3 Shopping Model of the Future: Why Any of This Matters</p>
        <p>Just as NFTs and DAOs reward their early adopters with what could be multi-million dollar airdrops, the Web3 shopping model of the future will follow suit. Shoppers will be directly rewarded for their brand loyalty for using the platform of their choice. Rewards could be seen through earning free shipping, discounts on purchases, lotteries, beta test access, exclusive brand specific NFTs, airdrops and much more.</p>
        <p>For merchants, the first main benefit of using decentralized systems is immediately removing the traditional 1.5 to 3.5% credit card processing fee per transaction. Merchants keep 100% of the funds when accepting stablecoins directly. Doing this math at scale, it becomes a no-brainer for merchants to benefit their bottom line. On top of this, traditional fiat funds take 1-2+ days to officially settle into a merchant’s account. This creates delays and inefficiencies, compared to stablecoin payments, which are settled nearly instantly. As previously mentioned, merchants who accept Bitcoin as a means of pay are subject to high volatility & using Ethereum is extremely expensive to use.</p>
        <p>For consumers, as it stands, crypto-natives are able to enjoy the benefits of stablecoins within the cryptosphere, but still have to go through the complex process of cashing out back to fiat to pay for “real world” purchases. Using DeFi as a means to transact unlocks a radically new way to spend save and earn which wouldn’t be possible without the blockchain. For instance, a user of the Terra Ecosystem could buy UST, deposit their savings balance into Anchor’s UST borrowing & lending pool and earn up to 19% APY on their savings…absolutely blowing anything from the traditional world out of the water. </p>
        <p>Although difficult to completely imagine what web3-enabled commerce will look like, we can use the streaming wars & current eCommerce market structures as a proxy of what the future may look like as consumers are ultimately the net benefiters of the “CAC wars”. </p>
        <p>Amazon created a race to the bottom with 2 day and in some instances, same day shipping. Domino’s led the pack with 30-minute deliveries. Netflix’s investments in original content like Squid Games, Black Mirror & Last Chance U force their competitors like Disney/Hulu, Amazon (who just purchased MGM for $9bn) and the like to double down on original content offering viewers the best bang for their buck, else they leave. Uber & Lyft’s race to the bottom forced Uber to diversify and out came a super-app where you can not only call a ride, but order food delivery, reserve a scooter and map out public transit options. Credit Cards also fight tooth and nail to win customers through a slew of cash back, points, airline miles, 0% APR for X months, reduced or even free partnership subscription services, you get the point.</p>
        <p>The team behind The Basic Attention Token (BAT) is an example of how users of decentralized networks get rewarded for using their product suites. If you use the Brave Browser, you not only get a native ad-blocker, cookies blocked and enhanced malware protection, but you’re also rewarded for the ads you view via $BAT tokens added to your wallet, paid out monthly (see image below). This is flipping the traditional ad model on its head as user privacy is prioritized as opposed to exploited and ad-viewers are rewarded for units of their time. Based on the model of internet browsing with Brave, we can see how commerce and spending online could follow suit.</p>
        <img src="stab5.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Discovery is arguably the hardest part of facilitating good eCommerce. Honey is a good example of this. Originally only a web browser extension, Honey tracks sales offerings and retailers’ promo codes, then automatically tries all the eligible promo coupons for a buyer during checkout & selects the one that provided the most savings and applies it on your behalf. This helps shoppers feel more comfortable with their purchases and reduces shopping cart abandonment. Data from 2019 shows its browser extension works across ~30,000 merchant websites, including fashion, technology, travel and even pizza delivery. Saving 17 million members more than $2bn to date. PayPal took notice of the work Honey was doing and acquired them for $4bn in a mostly cash deal. Again, showing how large the mega-cap strategic interest is for building out complete customer acquisition suites. When Web3 shopping models reach scale, players like PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and the like will be taking note and could pay high premiums for access to these new economies.</p>
        <img src="stab6.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Lolli is a great example of a company who’s building the Web3 Shopping rails. Lolli, a New York-based company partners with top stores that pay them when you shop. Once you make a purchase, merchants pay Lolli who then pays you in Bitcoin or USD to your Lolli Wallet – which can then be transferred to an external Bitcoin address.</p>
        <p>I did a double whammy and used Honey’s promo codes to get an additional 5% off plus ~8% back in BTC on my purchase from Everlane.</p>
        <img src="stab8.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Although Megacaps have made investments & partnerships around building out their capabilities in the space, it’s yet to be seen how they will completely flush out their offerings & niche down on their core competencies.</p>
        <p>Now that we’ve set the stage for what the Web3 shopping model may look like, let’s take a look at some of the players building in the space.</p>
        <img src="stab9.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>What was initially just the ability to swap crypto for fiat-denominated gift cards (Bitrefill) is growing into an ecosystem where builders can link their products to a native token and reward holders of the token for usage of their respective dApps.</p>
        <p>Building tools on-chain rather than simply integrating cryptocurrencies put players like Chai, Kado and Valora ahead of their larger and more established competitors like Wyre, Bitpay & Tala.</p>
        <img src="stab11.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>The Gen Z Demographic Tailwind: Special thanks to the BowTied Community for the TikTok commentary.</p>
        <p>Consumers more and more want to spend money with a brand that has a cohesive message for a given purpose, usually centered around a community. This is why many brands that have niched down are doing so well. They are connecting with an audience who genuinely wants to support them. We are seeing this live with the Shopify integration on TikTok. It could be that the audience of TikTok skews towards Gen Z, or that the format is completely different, but brands who just try to throw up traditional ads on other platforms generally are not performing well.</p>
        <img src="stab10.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>This is largely due to an algorithm that drives content to users based on unique interests – not just people or brands one follows (like on Instagram). Two things to look into if you are new to the platform: #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, peer reviewed hashtag on the platform that has now passed 3 billion views, leading Amazon to create its own page to track them all and voice overs. The ability to create sounds/voice effects for free, and avoid potentially expensive music licensing in the process, is a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p>
        <p>TikTok has also made a massive push into the crypto scene, announcing their own creator led NFT collection (LINK) and has partnered with crypto-native Audius for their new “TikTok Sounds” feature (LINK). A natural next step for TikTok could be to offer creators the ability to be paid out or tipped in BTC or a stablecoin of their choice. With social platforms like Rally, Roll and Deso now into the mix, consumers are becoming savvy to the idea of either tipping or owning their creator’s choice of tokens. It’s only a matter of time before TikTok takes note and flushes out their blockchain program accordingly. Combine the investments TikTok has made and the trends in social commerce & a future that allows Gen Z Consumers to pay with stables isn’t far from fruition. </p>
        <p>Concluding Thoughts</p>
        <p>The Web3 Shopping model of the future looks bright, either way you paint it – be it through the lens of Terra, Celo or USDC. Applications beyond traditional means of exchange are also super interesting to think about. Who’s building payment rails for the Metaverse? Imagine when you could pay for virtual goods and services on the same dApps that you buy cat food on from Amazon. What about virtual shopping malls? Terra and Celo are the largest platforms looking to build out the stack for blockchain-enabled commerce and it will be interesting to see how Celo is going to answer the $40bn in market cap whitespace between them and Terra. What’s even more exciting are that megacaps are also taking note that their consumers are demanding crypto payment, check out and custodial services. Envisioning a future that looks like a Brave Browser for commerce where merchants compete for your business through the incentives mentioned above (free shipping, bonus items, etc) is also a fun mental exercise. eCommerce is only one avenue that stablecoins can disrupt. What about ride-hailing services, food delivery, insert any saturated market and boom – there’s a world where decentralization can come into play just as Pancake Swap does with DEXs. </p>
        <p>To conclude, stablecoins unbound the walled gardens of centralized economies as for most, they know no borders and can be easily transferable. Remember, they are 1:1 pegs to the USD which reduces the volatility that crypto is known for. Participants in emerging economies like Nicaragua & Zimbabwe now have a safe way to gain USD exposure like never before. Algorithmic stablecoin ecosystems like Terra & Celo give users exposure to network growth and the ability to participate on the upside. Lolli, Kado and Valora are building version one of what the Web3 Shopping Model of the future will look like – possibly built off best practices from The Brave Browser. Brands are taking note and doubling down on their niches to best serve the growing class of digitally native consumers. The future we’re building on-chain is bright, exciting and I encourage you all to take a look at some of the dApps I mentioned.</p>

        <h6>Dec-2-2021</h6>
      </div>
      <div id = "content">
        <p>Ah yes…NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)....Probably Noting, Right? </p>
        <img src="nft1.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>The market that’s done $10.6bn in Gross Volume through the 3rd Quarter of 2021 alone. Maybe you’ve heard of them maybe not (you probably have though). </p>
        <p>Apes, Punks, Moneys, Chimps, Penguins, Snakes – you probably get the idea of what PFP (Profile Picture) NFT collections are..but there’s a whole other ecosystem behind that first layer. Here we explore life beyond PFP NFTs and some of the future trends propelling this industry forward. </p>
        <img src="nft2.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Projects take different approaches to their go-to-market strategy. Some are focused around a singular brand, others are tokens for a community, others allow you to redeem the digital for the physical and others are centered around gaming. </p>
        <p>As more brands take note from Budweiser who was instrumental in accepting the digital, the demand for NFTs and Ethereum will continue to rise. Seriously, what does a company like Budweiser have to do with NFTs? Not much. But for maybe $500k in design, development and execution costs, they “mint” themselves as one of the first CPG companies to foray into the space. In the crypto community, having a bud is now synonymous with “beer.eth” which is a very powerful asset to have in your brand portfolio. Other industries will likely follow suit, for instance, Nike could buy “run.eth” Weber “bbq.eth” Sephora: “makeup.eth” and so on. </p>
        <img src="nft3.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Above simply shows what some interesting trends might hold for NFTs. Until we’re able to actually “wear” the Coke Friendship Jacket, we will be displaying it on our wearables with Zerion. I don’t know why Travis Scott’s tickets to the May 2020 Fortnite concert haven’t been made into NFTs yet. Leasing and rent-to-own is an interesting model for floor prices of $100k+. IP-unbindling from some of the largest brands are also an obvious step in the right direction – but these organization are large, bloated and some offer “NFTs” but actually aren’t even on-chain. Maybe the middle-market companies are the ones to own their respective niches in the digital realm.. </p>
        <p>Okay so how do you buy one? </p>
        <p>It’s a pretty simple process actually<p/>
        <p>Set up an account with an exchange like Coinbase</p>
        <p>Buy Ethereum (not ETH2) </p>
        <p>Set up a Metamask Wallet. Copy your wallet address</p>
        <p>Send your Ethereum from Coinbase, to your copied Metamask wallet</p>
        <p>Find a collection that interests you. You can either mint a primary sale, directly from the website of the project…or buy on the secondary market on OpenSea</p>
        <p>Verify your transaction went through on a block explorer like Etherscan.io</p>
        <p>There you have it. How to buy your first NFT</p>

        <h2 id="soth" class="font-weight-light">And The Winner of The Metaverse is…Sotheby’s?</h2>
        <h6>Nov-23-2021</h6>
      </div>

      <div id = "content">
        <p>Let me explain: </p>
        <img src="soth1.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Sotheby’s has been absolutely instrumental in facilitating the exchange of Digital Assets. A British-founded American multinational HQ’d in New York City, it’s one of the world's largest brokers of fine art, and collectibles. </p>
        <p>A simple search for “Crypto” on the site doesn’t yield much other than a few NFTs for auction. But like with anything in this world, the value is beyond the first layer. </p>
        <img src="soth2.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>In June of 2021, Sotheby’s opened their Virtual Art Gallery in Decentraland and launched their first NFT Auction, Natively Digital. Showcasing some of the earliest, raw NFTs built on pre-Ethereum chains alongside newer, complex NFTs. Sotheby’s allowed bidders to pay in Ethereum, Bitcoin and USDC, as well as of course fiat currencies. </p>
        <p>The virtual auction house also sits on a prime location in Decentraland’s Voltaire Art District, the building is a replica of the auction house’s New Bond Street Galleries in London. Players can view, bid and use the location as a landmark to meet at – “Meet at Sotheby’s” has a nice ring to it. Below is my first foray into the gallery where Gold Bored Apes & the Kennel Club were on display. </p>
        <p>Currently, Sotheby’s has two collections on display on their Metaverse Gallery site (Metaverse.Sothebys.com), Natively Digital & Gifted: The 140 Collection. </p>
        <p>Natively Digital, as mentioned before was their first lot which auctioned some “blue-chip” NFT collections including Cryptokitties, Cool Cats, Bored Apes, Squiggles, Punks and Rare Pepes. </p>
        <p>Gifted: The 140 Collection is a set of NFTs launched by Twitter that illustrated the many facets of the platform itself, from the first iterations of its logo to its 140-character limit and more. The sale proceeds are going towards Sostento, an organization that gives vital support to frontline public health workers. </p>
        <p>In October, Sotheby’s along with others, invested in Mojito’s $20mm seed round. Mojito is building out an API platform and dashboard for launching and growing NFT marketplaces, games, and communities. </p>
        <p>In mid-November, Sotheby’s Announced Live Bidding Increments in Ethereum for Banksy’s 'Trolley Hunters' and 'Love Is In The Air' pieces. These two ended up selling for $6.6mm and $8.1mm respectively. </p>
        <img src="soth3.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Most recently, Sotheby’s made headlines as they facilitated the bidding of The US Constitution, with a main bidder being that of a DAO – ConstitutionDAO which raised over $40mm to participate in the auction. The group unfortunately didn’t win the piece and was outbid by Citadel’s Ken Griffin but it goes to show how far crypto has gone & how Sotheby’s is receptive to these new groups. Not to mention Ethereum also made headlines as it was a currency listed in the live steam of the auction. </p>
        <img src="soth4.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>To compare, banks have been taking the exact opposite route by pumping propaganda out against the blockchain and lobbying for the regulation of stablecoins. I think this is only the start for Sotheby’s foray into the digital asset space and I’m excited to see where they’re going. </p>

        <h2 id="eth2" class="font-weight-light">Why Staking Ethereum 2.0 on Coinbase is so important for the Crypto Community</h2>
        <h6>Nov-11-2021</h6>
      </div>

      <div id = "content">
        <p>In February of 2021, Coinbase alerted users of their platform that they can join a wait list to stake their Ethereum 2.0. Staking refers to the act of contributing your tokens “stake” as validators on the network to confirm transactions, in this case for the Ethereum Network. Holders lock up their stake to earn rewards which are represented in an APY – for ETH2 on Coinbase, you can make 4.50% annually. This is all in the context of a broader upgrade for the Ethereum Network, moving from a Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism (aka mining) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) system. The benefits are seen through faster transaction times, lower transaction fees (gas) and a reduced impact on the environment as mining becomes a relic of the past. </p>
        <p>Coinbase is currently the most frictionless consumer-oriented platform to gain crypto exposure with ~73 million users across 100+ countries. Their April 2021 IPO “minted” them as the first public pure-play crypto company, which brought about enormous goodwill to the industry. But crypto, (DeFi specifically) still faces high barriers to entry which are gated by a lack of education and poor user experience (what’s a DeFi wallet right? Who is Metamask?). The five personas I’ve laid out below demonstrate where we are at the tail end of 2021. </p>
        <img src="eth2-1.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Although next to impossible to peg, we can assume most centralized exchange users fit into the 2nd and 3rd categories which share that ~70 million+ odd user number. Those who go beyond centralized exchanges are at a minimum over 10 million, but can be as high as 170 million according the etherscan’s latest Ethereum unique address count. The DeFi Jedi cohort is probably around ~750k users (25% of the 3 million DEX participants). Of course there’s a huge impact of double counting as these cohorts are not mutually exclusive.  </p>
        <p>This paints a brush over how big the opportunity is for Coinbase to provide those 73 million users their first foray into DeFi, by staking ETH2. When staking was introduced in April, I immediately joined the waiting list. It was still very early in my personal crypto journey, so why wouldn’t I want earn up to 5% APY for holding something I already own? “Staking?” Whatever that means, It’s free money and who cares why or how, so I thought…oh how sweet the days of being blockchain curious were. </p>
        <p>After countless hours of researching the broader blockchain ecosystem, I finally wrapped my head around what were at the time, the arcane differences between Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms. </p>
        <p>Ethereum’s switch to PoS from PoW only made sense given the innovation that Ethereum has enabled for the blockchain ecosystems, ERC 20, 1115 & 71 standards. If you don’t know what any of that means, I suggest you take a look at my deep dive on Ethereum above. </p>
        <p>Then my lightbulb moment hit. This is what the “environmental concerns” are with Bitcoin mining that seem to cast a shadow across the broader crypto industry. This is why China, Tesla and other environmental critics constantly bash the industry for Bitcoin’s energy consumption. With the shift to PoS, Ethereum can revolutionize the industry again with sustainability as a core part of its ethos. </p>
        <p>The user of Coinbase is one that’s millennial, open to learning new things and willing to take risks. GME/AMC showed us how powerful the retail trade is. They care about purpose, the environment and backing companies & projects that are helping shape humankind. </p>
        <p>Right now, users can earn up to $29 in cryptocurrencies by watching educational videos on select tokens that have made themselves available on the “Coinbase Earn” platform. As an enthusiast and advocate for advanced transportation & mobility I was pleased to earn $5 in FET tokens for learning about Fetch.ai. If Coinbase can take those best practices from the “earn” platform, and apply them to the 6 tokens that offer staking rewards on the platform, that’s a whole new cohort of users who have taken their first DeFi step like I did in April. Below is a snapshot of the available tokens to stake and their respective APYs. </p>
        <img src="eth2-2.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>A significant amount of those 70 million users will have that “lightbulb moment” just as I did and given the millennial investor persona, will more likely than not be willing to participate in securing the Ethereum Network via staking. The more holders staking on the network, the more secure Ethereum becomes, transaction speed increases and the exorbitant gas fees we’ve recently been experiencing are a relic of the past. Users will also feel a sense of fulfilment just like I do in helping secure a such a revolutionary network such as Ethereum. More value locked in the best projects crypto has to offer will help transfer the shift mix from “Crypto=Bitcoin” to those who are eventually blockchain curious. The more people who explore the world of DeFi be it through staking, yield farming or undercollateralized loans, the broader our ecosystem becomes and further we can stray away from centralized authorities. As we approach that $3 trillion dollar total market cap, it doesn’t take too much imagination for one to see how staking stablecoins like UST on Terra for ~20% APY can absolutely blow the fixed income industries out of the water. All it takes is a single step in the right direction and I think staking ETH2 is that first step. </p>

        <h2 id="noncrypnat" class="font-weight-light">The Non-Crypto Native Players Leveraging Blockchain</h2>
        <h6>Nov-9-2021</h6>
      </div>
      <div id = "content">

        <p>As companies like Facebook, Microsoft & Nike announce plans to build “Metaverse infrastructure” it begs the question: Who’s done what and where?</p>
        <p>Here we take a look at some of the non-crypto native players building in the space. This is important to note as despite the headlines, there is so much more to crypto & blockchain than what the headlines tell you about NFTs.</p>
        <img src="NonCryptoNatives-v02.jpg" style="width:100%;">
        <p>NFT collections are the low-hanging fruit for brands to engage in crypto in the fastest way possible (remember Visa's Cryptopunk announcement that nearly broke the internet). Think of a company like Viacom CBS, which has treasure troves of IP from classics across the Paramount, MTV & Comedy Central brands. Although details of their NFT drop aren’t released, you could imagine a drop of SpongeBob’s jellyfish net, or an NFT video of MTV’s greatest hits from ’98 being released, I could go on..</p>
        <p>But what’s the end game for a Viacom CBS NFT collection? Surely not just to dump these digital assets onto consumers just to be marveled at in a wallet - I think it’s much much more than that. It’s the idea that eventually you can have a skit from Tim Dillon on Comedy Central playing on loop in your virtual display in your Decentraland parcel, or to wear the Coke NFT Friendship jacket in the Metaverse on your avi.</p>
        <p>Automotive OEMs have formed alliances to track parts at various portions of their journey via the blockchain. Traditional Finance players are building networks to better facilitate exchange through loans, derivatives & trade financing. Sotheby’s of all companies has impressed me the most here. They’ve gone towards massive lengths to stay relevant within the digital art realm, auctioning off some of the most expensive NFT art & have built a Decentraland HQ which also doubles as a virtual art studio:</p>
        <img src="DG.jpg" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Instead of focusing on the physical, Sotheby's is embracing the digital..now imagine if banks & financial institutions would have followed suit instead of combatting DeFi & spreading anti-crypto propaganda.</p>
        <p>All of these moves by non-crypto native players help give "validity" to the now <strong>$3 Trillion <strong>space and brings us closer to a world connected through blockchain technology. Maybe first through centralized alliances within respective verticals but eventually in a decentralized, cross-chain & open manner.</p>
        <p>Two notable mentions are Tesla & MicroStrategy which are non-crypto natives that both hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet for a collective sum of around ~ 150,000 coins.</p>

        <img src="ENJ7.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Enjin is building an ecosystem which will enable cross-chain gaming, in a true “Ready Player One “ fashion. Gone are the days of putting multiple hours of gameplay in, only for your game developer studio to either shut down the game or remove functionality for your specific in-game asset. </p>
        <p>One gamer’s experience with centralized gaming stands out in particular, “He happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from his beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. He cried himself to sleep, and on that day realized what horrors centralized services can bring.” His name is Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum. </p>
        <p>A stark comment to say the least. Many of us have experienced this issue, be it a leveled-up Diamond Sword on Minecraft, Ebony Armor on Skyrim, or Porter’s X2 Ray Gun on Kino Der Toten. Centralized gaming sucks, but it’s all we’ve ever had. Until now. </p>
        <p>Enjin is looking to bring the power back in the hands of the players, by making your in-game items Non Fungible Tokens that are unique to you and only you. Your armor, swords, potions and power ups are now assets on the blockchain. Upon leveling up a sword, a player can bring that from one realm to another and if they want, melt or list it on Enjin’s marketplace for ENJ denominated value which can then be swapped from ENJ -> ETH & back to fiat for real-world value. </p>
        <p>This is the ethos of true “play to earn” which the likes of Axie Infinity, Illuvium and MyNeighborAlice are trying to do, but with major publishing risk. Honestly, these games are not very fun. I think Axie & others helped paved the way for proof of concept for “play to earn” but for players to gold rush into a game like Illuvium with dollar signs in their eyes in order to train an Illuvial just to level it up & sell it on a marketplace seems..nearsighted. </p>
        <p>Enter Enjin, whos’ taking on no publishing risk and is acting like “the Shopify for gaming” with their full-stack platform, or in crypto terms, “the Ethereum for gaming”. Developers can get set up with Enjin in as little as 48 hours, with Versatile SDKs, a robust API framework, and development tools to create NFT-powered projects with no blockchain coding experience required. Why have your game developer be both the publisher and the platform enabler? The Wealth of Nations taught us that breaking down & dividing labor is a good thing as it saved industrial time and resources. Only in this case, its saving developer time & can translate into a better gamer experience. </p>
        <p>Upon adopting blockchain gaming, devs will have immense network effects that far out pace the economics of centralized economies. Players can level up their items, then sell or trade them on marketplace for ENJ denominated value to which the devs can take a % of sale from. Enjin’s Beam technology also allows for users to scan QR codes to have special NFT drops, which will immensely increase gamer retention in a very simple way that wasn’t possible without blockchain. </p>
        <p>The analysis presented shows where Enjin could trade at upon successful execution of their Efinity Blockchain & further AAA game developers onboarding to the platform. I believe there’s immense whitespace opportunity for Enjine to capitalize on “being the glue” that brings together platforms like Roblox, Facebook, Decentraland, Activision and Take Two Games to a whole new level that gamers have been so actively desiring. </p>

        <h2 id="meta" class="font-weight-light">An Overview of Facebook's META Rebrand</h2>
        <h6>Oct-29-2021</h6>
      </div>
      <div id = "content">
        <p>While many including myself are laughing at Facebook’s rebrand to META, this is a huge sign of validation for the broader web3 industry. For better or for worse, just as memecoins introduce people to what crypto is, Facebook is at the least adding the word “metaverse” to about 2.9 billion MAUs’ vocabulary – and the data shows:</p>
        <img src="meta1.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Even if only 1% of those MAUs convert to their Horizon Home platform, that’s still 29 million people engaging in a VR-enabled world, which will eventually cross pollinate into blockchain worlds.</p>
        <p>Off the heels of the Ethereum rally which started around the end of September, alt coins as a whole have been on an absolute tear. Pure-Play Metaverses & Supporting Platforms seemed to benefit the most as Decentraland, Decentral Games, The Sandbox & Enjin were all up over 50%, with the broader Metaverse Index (MVI) up over 30% since the October 19th announcement.</p>
        <img src="meta2.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Despite Facebook’s $10bn planned CapEx over the next few years & their 2.9bn MAUs, I personally believe the future of interactive technology / metaverse will not be built by bloated dev teams & an infinite balance sheet. It’s going to take skill, passion & nimble leadership, which is why I’d rather bet on the likes of smaller, crypto native players like the ones above. As I said earlier, this is a huge step in the right direction for the broader space, Facebook even got a nice 4% pop on the day of announcement. A lot of institutional ownership & non-crypto native retail will likely add Facebook to their portfolio as a means to get “Metaverse exposure” similarly to how those did buying Coinbase at IPO to get “Bitcoin exposure.”</p>
        <p>I’m hopeful & optimistic that this announcement will bring more adoption to Web3, Metaverses & Blockchain Gaming.</p>

            <p>As exponential as the growth has been over the last 14 months, we’re still FAR FAR away from a substantial amount of the population adopting Crypto & the broader blockchain ecosystem. Coinbase’s IPO brought our name into the limelight, and NFT art is driving the cultural validation behind Crypto but concepts like DAOs, Metaverse and even Yield Farming are too arcane for most (i.e. I wouldn’t expect my 50 y/o mother to open a Coinbase acct, buy ETH, open a Metamask, then link her Metamask to mint a Cryptokitty (all the while paying 100% of the mint’s value in gas?)) – we have a fundamental user accessibility & knowledge problem….for now.</p>

        <p>I spoke with a well-regarded colleague of mine about the Crypto market as a whole, we discussed the cool things like NFTs, Metaverse and the proliferation of DAOs. But it struck me that although these “headline topics” have become a part of the mainstream part of discourse, there is still a huge knowledge gap of how these technologies are developed and what the drivers are of them. In this piece, I dive into a surface-level introduction of what Ethereum is and why you should care about it.</p>

        <img src="ETH6.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Note that none of the above headlines would be possible without Ethereum. Ethereum is the electricity for our lightbulbs per se. It’s enabled the $40bn DeFi market, the ~$10bn in YTD NFT trade volume and is what’s fueling the growth of web3.</p>

        <p>Here’s a quick snapshot of my portfolio at this instance in time. On the equity side, I have a heavy affliction towards eCommerce and goods marketplaces. Covid brought about a step change in demand for eCommerce and the pie is only growing bigger as retail eCommerce is expected to be a $6tn industry by 2024. </p>
        <p>Generally, I have three investment parameters: Electric Vehicles / Advanced Transportation, Frontier Technology (Space Economy, Landscape Changing Software), eCommerce (all things driving the internet’s GDP) and Digital Media / Connectivity. These three industries are underpinned my massive macro tailwinds coming off covid, but also into the future (i.e. shift towards digitalization, unbundling of the vehicle and space as the next frontier). </p>
        <p>On the Blockchain / Crypto side, I feel like I am learning every single day. DEXs remind me of marketplaces, social token platforms and NFT gaming are replacing the old guard of the likes of Facebook, Spotify, Activision Blizzard etc. This is by far the most exciting portion of my overall portfolio and currently only represents ~8% of total exposure. </p>
        <p>I’m excited to continually invest in the future of DeFi & Web3 as I have a 7-10 year timeline.</p>

        <p>The U.S. auto industry sold a little over 3.4 million cars in 2020.</p>
        <p>That year, total car and light truck sales were between 14 and 15 million in the United States.</p>
        <p>U.S. vehicle sales peaked in 2016 at roughly 17.5 million units.</p>
        <p>This exact trend is what's driving two key things: decreased car ownership & a shift towrds the "modularization" of vehicles (i.e. electric, compact, efficient (gone is the sould of the American V8 (or my personal favorite, the E92 BMW M3)))</p>
        <p>With Robotaxis on the scene, and car sales fllaing, it begs the question as to who will fill the void when consumers need wheels to get from SF to LA, SF to Monterey, Marin, Yosemote? Why pay for Parking, Insuracne, Gas, Maintenece? All so that your car can sit idle for 96% of the time when it isnt used?</p>
        <p>Enter first GIG and now Kyte on the scene. These platforms are matching drivers with wheels so they can "Get in and Go" (GIG). Sure, Robotaxis aer coming, but to say that 100% of cars will be off the road by 2030 is a far cry. Kyte and others are bridging that gap towards low / no vehicle ownership, while paving the way to AVs.</p>

        <p>I had first opened a Coinbase account in 2017 to buy a fake ID with my old college buddy. I just recently reactivated the account, and saw that I had a GDAX & Binance account as well. The accounts unfortunatley had only a deminimis amount of money! (Sigh). Anyways, it's 2021 now and I've been inveting nearly every investable dollar into the broader Cyto market as a whole. More more more to come on my general portfolio management strategy next.</p>
        <p>We've recently seen the DeFi Summer with Apes emerging as an asset class, the prolferation of the "Metaverse" NFT based communities and insane yield farming.</p>
        <p>Just taking a look at Bitcoin as a multiple of Gold, we're about 11x smaller than the Gold market, which is a proxy of what BTC can be once it reahes steady state as a true store of value.</p>
        <p>It would be amazing if BTC is adopted as a true virtual store of value as opposed to gold, Ethereum become what the internet / wifi is of DeFi and Web3, and the evenetual PoS platforms to become the Apple, Amazon Googles of Web3. What a thought.</p>
        <img src="crypto-benchmarking.JPG" style="width:100%;">
        <p>The above highlights some interesting protocols and KPIs I've found useful to benchmark..it's stark how early we all are (even still) to this new wave.</p>

        <p>2020 has been an unreal year for the books. I'm happy and humbled that I've been able to stick to my investment philosophy throughout the Covid crash, GME bubble and everything in between.</p>
        <p>My new strategy upon making a new investment is to buy long term OTM options for the company I'm looking to value in 3-5 years. If the fundamental premise of valuation is that of discounting future cashflows 3-5 years from now, there is no reason intraday, or even monthly swings should bother me. This option strategy will help me juice return without having to employ the use of leverage.</p>
        <p>A macro thought on the future of my investing philosophy: I want to position myself to reap the benefits of the “experience based economy.” Experiences – as in real life experiences, not digital ones. Experiences that Blade, Airbnb, Virgin Galactic and others can bring. Gone are the days of “consumption” of hard goods to derive joy. Consumers today care about experiences that are finite, but last infinitely in their hearts and minds. </p>

        <p>The Wix & BigCommerce Bull Thesis & eCommerce as a whole: “The transition from physical to digital commerce constitutes one of history’s biggest changes in human behavior, and the pace of change is accelerating. According to eMarketer Inc. (“eMarketer”), retail ecommerce was nonexistent in the early-1990s and grew to approximately 10% of all global retail spending in 2017. They predict it will take just six years for this percentage to more than double to 21% of global retail spending in 2023” Shopify certainly can’t take all of the eCommerce market. Just as Tesla can’t all of the EV market. There are so many middle market companies who either sell exclusively through retailers or have antiquated webcarts that need to transition to centralized, well built eCommerce hosting platforms that offer their management teams the ease and flexibility of a SaaS platform. </p>
        <p>Amazon is one channel, a very specific channel, but as the CEO of a company my bank is engaged to sell noted, “Webcart is the future. We have complete autonomy, creative control and it’s the highest gross margin channel for us. We are certainly committed to building out our webcart sales.” </p>
        <p>Covid nailed the coffin shut for retail as consumers have been forced to either buy completely online, Amazon or “buy online and pickup in store” – these tailwinds will last far into the future. I’m not a retail bear, I’m just bullish on eCommerce being the future of consumption due to how easy it is to buy online rather than lugging yourself around a car to get to Target. This precipitated a significant shift in shopping behavior from offline to online. In June 2020, eMarketer predicted that U.S. brick and mortar retail spending will decline by 14% in 2020, whereas U.S. consumer ecommerce spending will increase by 18%, the highest growth rate since their coverage began in 2008.</p>
        <p>WIX is also a bet on the future of the “no code” software development cycle and the democratization of app building. Couple that with content creators popping up left and right and I think there are levers to pull for post covid growth from WIX.</p>
        <p>      .......At a macro level, this is how I think about the world.</p>

        <h2 class="font-weight-light">Spotify's Unique Problem: Monetization</h2>
        <h6>Dec-4-2020</h6>
      </div>
      <img src="SPOT-Unique-Problem.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content">
        <p>320 Million Monthly Active Users and 144 Million paying subscribers – myself proudly included.  Spotify has a treasure trove of users, their listening habits, preferences and tastes all in one mainly mobile app. It’s waiting to turn on the money making machine and extract both their user’s time and digital media consumption. Spotify can pull levers for growth by investing in: Original Content, “Shopifying” the artist experience and through a slew of multimedia offerings.</p>
        <p>Spotify was founded in 2006 and 14 years later, they have become the leading platform for music streaming. But it shouldn’t end there. Spotify should further add original content offerings to become a discovery platform, which happens to be the market leading music streaming service at the same time. Spotify has already started with podcasting, adding the Joe Rogan Experience and Michelle Obama podcasts under Spotify’s exclusivity. These are investments in original and exclusive content that will keep eyes and ears on the platform. Video capability was also a transformative addition to the JRE Podcast that no other podcasting service offers, with exception to Youtube when his shows were there.</p>
        <p>Spotify is also investing in multimedia, partnering with DC Comics to bring Batman Unburied and unveiled and E-sports partnership with Riot Games’ League of Legends as well as Chernin Entertainment to develop the owned podcast IP into film, television, and digital series projects. All in an effort to attract and reward podcast creators. This investment in both podcasting and video on demand is what will bring more eyes and ears onto the platform. The next logical step would be live events: think MMA, concerts, Travis-Scott x Fornite-like events as well as even a Periscope like feature for artists to connect with fans. Building a multimedia flywheel with music at the core of the offering will be key in both keeping and growing marketshare.</p>
        <p>“Shopifying” the artist experience. It’s hard enough to become an artist as well as launching an e-Commerce site. Building artist tools will create a two sided marketplace: for consumers and producers of digital media. Spotify has already partnered with Universal Music Group to help build out new tools and offerings, creator teams to connect, create, and grow their audiences on the platform</p>
        <p>-	The investment in promo cards, which are a new tool that allows creators to make shareable social media assets for songs, albums, podcasts, and artist profiles is a great inroad. The company has also built Spotify Analytics — a data tool for labels and distributors — into Spotify for Artists, to establish one unified fan development platform for the music industry.</p>
        <p>-	Artist fundraising, like Shopify’s SMB loans are a way to better support artists to amplify their fundraising efforts on their Spotify profiles. Additionally, in September Spotify launched support for artist teams to promote their virtual events on their Spotify profile and our Concerts hub, spaces that previously only featured in-person events.</p>

        <h2 class="font-weight-light">Airbnb Pre-IPO Key Takeaways</h2>
        <h6>Dec-4-2020</h6>
      </div>
      <img src="ABNB-Airbnb-Profile-v12.04.2020.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content">
        <p>A new category of travel, synonymous with “Google It” is now “I’m going to Airbnb it for the weekend”. The peer to peer gig economy has exploded over the last 10 years with the likes of Uber, Lyft, Fiverr and now Airbnb going public. The question remains: will growth continue as a public company entering maturity, or is there still significant upside potential to holding shares in Airbnb. </p>
        <p>Sure, Airbnb has been hit by Covid, but with vaccines looking promising, there’s no reason why by Q3 2021, bookings and revenue will normalize and for Q3 2022 – revenue can’t skyrocket YoY back to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
        <p>Travel is one of the world’s largest industries, and its approach has become commoditized. The travel industry has scaled by offering standardized accommodations in crowded hotel districts and frequently-visited landmarks and attractions. This one-size-fits-all approach has limited how much of the world a person can access, and as a result, guests are often left feeling like outsiders in the places they visit.</p>
        <p>In early 2020, as COVID-19 disrupted travel across the world, Airbnb’s business declined significantly. But within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience. People wanted to get out of their homes and yearned to travel, but they did not want to go far or to be in crowded hotel lobbies. Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home. Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became work-from-any-home on Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere. Our platform has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling.</p>
        <p>The business is resilient, it can quickly dial down fixed costs (laying off 25% of their staff – and I’d bet they would gladly come back to work too). It has a strong brand loyalty, it is better perceived not necessarily better suited for pandemic and post pandemic travel than hotels as people are traveling within driving distance, are staying longer, prefers non-shared accommodations such no as a shared apartment or hotel room, and are spending more. Finally, it’s a win-win proposition: need extra income? Rent out a room or extra property. Want to travel? Get a room in someone’s place or a full apartment.</p>
        <p>Unlike many other two-sided marketplaces, traveling is not a “trend”. It’s been with humans forever and as the pandemic shows, not even a deadly plague stops people from wanting to travel.</p>
        <p>Based on the private market valuations, at $35bn, this is fair value, however I believe that the IPO will be oversubscribed to and in the short term won’t make sense to purchase. However, over the long term I’m bullish on the business as well as investments the company has made in tailored experiences and international expansion.</p>

      <img src="BYND-Beyond-Meat-Profile.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content">
        <p>Beyond Meat is at the forefront of a cultural shift towards healthy, sustainable and clean eating. The company has strategically partnered with some of the largest fast food and quick serve restaurants in the U.S. and globally. This gives first time consumers a "gentle introduction" into plant-based alternatives.</p>
        <p>Beyond Meat also has the culture on their side. In October of 2017, Leonardo DiCaprio announced his status as both an investor in the company and a public advocate for the brand. This brings immense goodwill towards the brand which will help propell the moated brand Beyond has as well as help convert first time customers, which is such a crucial part of the business.</p>
        <p>Further diligence will be required to assess the viability of an investment opportunity. Personally, I've had an impossible burger (Unami Burger and Whalburger in SF and Palo Alto) and they taste fine with me. It might be an issue that Beyond is targeting fast food / QSR establishments, but that comes with more sales exposure (as opposed to smaller mom and pop shops like it seems that Impossible has a larger foothold in. </p>

        <p>This analysis was inspired by watching "The Founder" - the story about Ray Kroc and the McDonald family. It showed the relationship between the two and eventual fallout, a tragic yet optimal outcome for the McDonald family, but it was what needed to happen.</p>
        <p>This made me think a lot about the fast food industry, and business as a whole. The flywheel above the chart shows how mission driven businesses start "focus on quality" MCD in the beginning (the speedy -system and a focused menu [only burgers and fries as well as non-powdered milk shakes]). Fast forward towards McDonalds today, and we see cost cutting across the board (powdered milk shakes), chicken sandwiches, fish fillets, chicken tenders, and now impossible burgers…. or eventually. If you watch the movie, Dick McDonald made it a point that when McDonalds franchised their franchisees would deviate from the menu, cuts costs and quality fell as a result.</p>
        <p>Parallels between In and Out today and McDonalds in 1955 are stark when comparing the two. Think limited menu, emphasis on the speedy system and quality being the #1 ingredient.</p>
        <p>What does this mean for strategy & business as a whole? Scale brings problems that question the fundamental truths a business & mission were built on. Think Uber & Lyft – they wanted to make something different, a different experience, a rider centric approach. Fast forward 10 years later, they’ve been hit with regulatory burden from hubs like SF & NYC with a medallion system very similar to that of which Uber was trying to combat in the first place. The same mission that In and Out, Shake Shack and Five Guys build their businesses on (de-commoditizing the burger).</p>
        <p>It’s no surprise that In and Out and McDonalds are polar opposites on nearly every measurable metric. So super size me, but at your own risk.</p>

Both have drawbacks when including mega cap FAANG names as with the market cap weighted index, Apple would dominate the movement, while with the price weighted index, we see that Amazon is dominating the price movements.</p>
      <p>An ETF that holds portfolio weights is probably the best medium for an index tracker since the aggregate price movement of the index is primarily driven by the % of asset allocation rather than price or market cap.</p>
      <p>My next project is to create a price weighted index pulling companies from the Mana landscape in real time via Yahoo Finance APIs to show on the header in real time.</p>

          <h2 class="font-weight-light">Unpopular Opinion: Technology Is A Tool, Not A Business Model</h2>
        <h6>May-23-2020</h6>
      </div>
      <img src="Technology-Is-A-Tool.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content"> <p>Despite my start within TMT and Industrials Technology Investment Banking, this took me a while to understand. Technology is a tool, not a business model.</p>
      <p>There is no such thing as a "technology business" - only companies that leverage technology, such as in the case of Tesla, improved battery metrics, autonomous hardware and software as well as advanced manufacturing processes.</p>
      <p>This thought process can be applied to any industry, which is what results in the emergence of 'FAANG' = Facebook (an internet business that leverages big data and machine learning to improve friend networks, and newsfeed - supported by an ad-based model), Apple (a computer and phone designer that leverages design technology, cloud computing and other software-based developer tools) - pinned up by an app store ecosystem, hardware sales and a growing subscription revenue platform, Amazon (a logistics / e-Commerce company that levereages machine learning to give you the best product reccomendations, enable 2-day shipping and optimize warehouses through robotics) - supported by e-Commerce sales and Prime Subscriptions, Netflix (originally a content aggregator and DVD subscription service, leveraged machine learning technology to give users content reccomendations) underpinned by subscriptions and is now investing in Netflix original content and finally, Google (a true internet company that build the foundation of search, but is leveraging AI, Machine Learning and nearly every other kind of technology to add to their many business lines, Waymo, Stadia, Search, Fiber and Nest) - underpinned by an ad word and search business.</p>
      <p>Now let's get into some 'tech businesses' - the most recent example of this is the explosion of autonomous vehicle startups such as Peloton Trucking, Drive.ai, UberATG, Baidu, Aurora, ZOOX, Nuro, Cruise by GM, DeepMap, Starsky Robotics, Argo AI, Tesla AVs, Waymo - I could go on forever...</p>
      <p>A slew of the names I mentioned before started by raising inordinate sums of Venture Capital, in order to fund what were essentially expensive research projects (go scientists) - because they had no underlying business model in conjunction with the technology development.</p>
      <p>It seems like the ones who are winning the AV race are the well capitalized companies that have underlying businessmodels with healthy balance sheets, cash flow conversion and access to capital markets ex: Waymo, Tesla, Aptiv etc. </p>
      <p>I belive there needs to be an underlying business model before the introduction of buzzword technology that will help support the beforementioned business.</p>

      <div id = "content"> <p>Mana can be found within all consumer apps, which I still need to build a complete landscape for. However, there is immense value to Enterprise SaaS companies that fix major pain points for enterpise users with long contract values that promote sticky products, which result in high cashflow conversion and even higher Revenue and EBITDA multiples.</p>

      <div id = "content">
        <p>February 21st, the SP500 was at $3,337, upon the Coronavirus sell off, we hit a low of $2,237 on March 23rd (ironically) – shaving off 32% in under a month.</p>
        <p>Come May 16th and the SP 500 closes at $2,863, a 15% drawdown – yet we’ve seen record unemployment numbers over the last eight weeks with about 36.5 million people filing for unemployment insurance, pushing the rate to an unprecedented 17% - levels we haven’t seen since pre-WWII and the 1929 Great Depression..</p>
        <p>...Yet stocks are rebounding as indices are broadly up since their March 23rd lows... </p>
        <p>It seems paradoxical to say that a lot of the opportunities I’m eyeing are ‘overbought’ as we see that Peloton has swept tailwinds from the exercise from home trends, regardless of sales have increased to the point where it justifies an 88% share price gain on the year. As a matter of fact, all companies that I’m eying are up 20%+ unless they have a retail footprint such as Revolve and The Real Real (down -60% & -56% respectively).</p>
        <p>But this isn’t an essay about the macro economy as a whole, or the misnomers of the market, its an analysis on some future opportunities that: at a high level 1) fit the Mana mandate, 2) are good businesses to invest in once valuations are more attractive, and 3) will require more diligence (specifically the ones with targeted in red) on an investment opportunity. </p>
        <p>A note on portfolio management: I don’t need to invest in these new companies either, there will be a limit for my independent research capabilities, however being able to silo my investments in a theme help consolidate the general research I’d need to do for companies like Shopify, Chewy, Revolve etc.. But again, I don’t need to invest in these companies – it just adds more work on my end eventually. </p>
        <p>I had the fortune to not look at my portfolio during the depths of the pandemic (mainly because I had no cash to invest) but now that things are looking better, I might look to add more to my positions – or double down on my frontier investments that have been hit the hardest. </p>
        <p>Part 2 will come with an indepth reveiew of the selected opportunities.</p>

        <h2 class="font-weight-light">What Will The Future Of Investment Banking Look Like?</h2>
        <h6>April-22-2020</h6>
      </div>
      <img src="IB-revenues.jpg" style="width:100%;">
      <div id = "content"> <p>With interest rates at record low levels, the question for managers arise: Buy, Build or Partner? This then raises another question: How will we fund the choice we make? Through Debt or Equity? If you ask a Boutique Bank, a majority of their answers will point towards equity as they don't have a debt desk and look towards the advisory fee. So then for managers, they must decide: hire a boutique bank with sector expertise and thought leadership? Or hire a full-service bulge bracket bank that can provide staple financing - if needed. Of course this is simplifying the process, but the point still stands.</p>
        <p>Do we chalk up Investment Banking success to rainmakers at the firm? Incentive packages through stock and options? Higher deal fee splits? Or Merging let's say a Jeffereis Group with a Stephens Inc. to create a JeffereisStephens Group - which will equate to a firm that has enhanced Capital Markets capabilities, a stronger balance sheet and a larger deal making team to spearhead a larger fee pool. Arguably enabling two Middle Market firms to compete within the larget Bugle Bracket category. </p>
        <p>What goes to say for independent M&A Advisors such as Centerview, Moelis, LionTree, FT Partners and PWP? All of the likes started with similar rainmakers defuncting from their bulge bracket homes to create a more nimble, independent advisory firm. When these founders leave the babies they created - what will become of their brands and the franchises they sought to build? For one thing, having a name that is founder agnostic might help. But without pursuing diversifed  revenue streams, these businesses might falter in the future.</p>
        <p>Or they could become the likes of a Lazard, legacy advisory shop, founded in 1848 and commits to pure advisory services..</p>
        <img src="Investment-banking2-2019.png" style="width:100%;">
        <p>Investment Banking is no different than any other industry. Scale, Revenue Growth and Margins are essentials to business and when one goes public, pressure is put on to maximize those metrics above. The most recent wave of consolidation has come from the merger of Piper Jaffray and Sandler O'Neill as Piper Sandler Companies. The resulting company represents one of the broadest full-service investment banking platforms on Wall Street complemented by one of the largest securities distribution and trading franchises with leading market research aligned to serve the middle-market.</p>
        <p>So maybe we will see an eventual JeffereisStephens Groups, or a RaymondJefferies Group...</p>

      <div id = "content"> <p>Virgin Galactic is an interesting play because they fit right into this lens I'm trying to analyze industrial companies in: High Margin, Technologically Advanced, American Manufacturing with prominent leadership – Virgin has all of this. This business is reminiscent of Tesla in the early days. We entered this investment around February and have been taking hits from their speculation as well as the damper from the CoronaVirus.

      <p>With respect to their TAM and opening this up to the masses, I feel there is a fundamental business of selling the space experience here. $250k is not that much to spend on a one in a lifetime event like this. Imagine a Kardashian live streaming from space, or someone live streaming the first trade from space, the first MMA fight from space etc..</p>
      <p>At the core, Virgin is an entertainment company and Branson is using Space as a platform so sell experiences.</p>

          <li> April 2012: Facebook Acquired Instagram to appeal to a younger crowd </li>
          <li> To Snap’s demise, Evan Spiegel reportedly turned down an acquisition offer from Facebook in late 2013</li>
          <li> August 2016 rolls around and Instagram adds Stories to the platform, Snapchat’s defining feature</li>
          <li> In the mean time, Persicope was founded in March 2015, a platform for users to live broadcast themselves to people who tune into their periscopes </li>
          <li> Facebook introduced Instagram Live Stories in November 2016 – which was Persicope’s defining feature: a smaller company again had their defining feature stolen by Facebook – not to say that any company ‘owns’ a piece of software – it’s software for god’s sake</li>
          <li> VSCO has failed to scale as people truly like ‘likes’ and numbers on their impressions – is there room for a platform to scale without the use of likes and followers? TechCrunch cites that in the midst of the CoronaVirus crisis VSCO has laid off 30% of their workforce</li>
        </ul>
      <p>However, It seems like FinTech startups have rose up in the face of incumbents (Cash App’s rise because they serve the underserved areas/segments?! – a snippet from Jack Dorsey on the Joe Rogan Podcast) – all this success in relation to Venmo, ebay, Paypal, VISA, etc… Fintech might be a new vertical to analyze...</p>
